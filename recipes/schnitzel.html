        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A schnitzel is a thin slice of meat. The meat is usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most commonly, the meat is breaded before frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>rim pork chops of fat and slice into 1/2</li>
            <li>Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, use a fork to beat 3 eggs. In the third bowl, add 2 cups panko crumbs.</li>
            <li>Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in beaten egg letting excess egg drip back into the bowl before breading in panko crumbs. It helps to use a fork for the dipping process to keep your hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>
            <li>Once all cutlets are breaded, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot, add breaded cutlets a few at a time and saut√© 3-4 minutes per side or until cooked through.</li>
        </ol>
